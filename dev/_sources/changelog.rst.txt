This details the changes made from the previous recorded version.

2.0.0
======

- Package exports semantic style

    - Default export is now a semantic object that follows the convention of Verb-Noun.
    - Verbs available are : ``get``, ``create``, ``serialize``, ``deserialize``, ``is``. Read the ``index.js`` file of each module to know what they export.
    - Modules are individually available as named exports. If you just need account methods, ``import { wallet } from 'neon-js'``

- Constants and util methods are now exported as::

    import Neon from 'neon-js'
    Neon.CONST.DEFAULT_RPC
    Neon.u.reverseHex

    import { CONST, u } from 'neon-js'
    CONST.DEFAULT_RPC
    u.reverseHex

- Wallet Refactor

    - Account is now available as a class instead of a JS object. Account is now the recommended way to manage keys.
    - Removed ``getAccountFromWIFKey`` and ``getAccountFromPrivateKey``
    - Key manipulation methods streamlined to the minimum. No more ``getAddressFromPrivateKey``.  Methods now only transform the key one level.
    - Key verification methods fully implemented for every possible key format. Follows convention of ``isKeyFormat``.

- RPC package

    - RPCClient class models a NEO Node. Instantiate with ``Neon.create.rpcClient(url)``. Comes with built-in methods for RPC calls.
    - Query class models a RPC call. Instantiate with ``Neon.create.query()``. Comes with built-in methods for RPC calls.

- 3rd Party API

    - neon-wallet-db API is shifted to ``api`` folder.
    - Added coinmarketcap query support for easy price queries.
    - Token query (NEP5) is shifted here.

- Deploy Script Support

    - ``generateDeployScript`` in ``sc`` is a wrapper for generating a deploy script.

1.1.0
=====

- Transaction Overhaul

    - Transactions are now exposed semantically with the convention of Verb-Noun.
    - Transaction creation is exposed as ``create.claim``, ``create.contract`` and ``create.invocation``
    - Transactions can be serialized or deserialzed using ``serializeTransaction`` and ``deserializeTransaction``
    - Transaction signing is now ``signTransaction`` and it returns the signed transaction instead of having to manually attach the signature.
    - Transaction Hash can be calculated using ``getTransactionHash`` passing in the transaction object.

- ScriptBuilder for Smart Contract invocation

    - ScriptBuilder class is an object used to build VM scripts that mirrors the ScriptBuilder found in the C# repo.
    - ``buildScript`` is a convenient wrapper around ScriptBuilder to call a contract with ``operation`` accepting ``args``.

- getAccount methods renamed to getAccount and returns a single Account object instead of an array

    | getAccountsFromWIFKey -> getAccountFromWIFKey
    | getAccountsFromPrivateKey -> getAccountFromPrivateKey
