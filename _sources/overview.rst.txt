Usage
=====

Neon can be used in 2 ways:

Semantic

    The default import for Neon is a Javascript object where functions are arranged in a semantic manner following the convention of Verb-Noun. If a method goes beyond 2 levels, the rest of the name is camelCased at the Noun level.

    ::

      import Neon from 'neon-js'
      Neon.create.privateKey()
      Neon.serialize.tx(transactionObj)
      Neon.get.publicKeyFromPrivateKey(privateKey)

    This style is recommended for beginners or anyone who just wishes to use Neon without hassle.

Named

    Named imports are the conventional JS imports. The modules in Neon are:

      - ``wallet``
      - ``tx``
      - ``rpc``
      - ``u``
      - ``api``
      - ``CONST``

    This style offers more control and flexibility. Do refer to the source code for each module's exports.
